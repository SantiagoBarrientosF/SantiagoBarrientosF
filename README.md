## ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome!

I'm a backend developer passionate about building robust and scalable web applications. I specialize in frameworks like Laravel, Django, and Flask, and I enjoy working with Python and PHP to create APIs and tools that solve real-world problems.

ðŸ”§ My skills include:
- Backend development with Laravel, Django, and Flask  
- API development and database management (MySQL, PostgreSQL)  
- Version control with Git and GitHub  
- Basic frontend knowledge (CSS, JavaScript)

ðŸš€ Some of my projects involve processing and organizing data, creating APIs for tourism platforms, and developing file-handling tools that present and export data in a user-friendly way.

ðŸ’¡ I'm always learning and looking for opportunities to grow as a developer. Feel free to explore my repos or reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate!
